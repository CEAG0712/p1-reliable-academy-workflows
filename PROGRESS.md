# P1 - Development Progress

## Source of Truth

- Repository: CEAG0712/p1-reliable-academy-workflows
- Branch: main
- Source files and tests determine implemented behavior.
- This document tracks work status, not proof of correctness by itself.

## Verified Repository Baseline

- Last confirmed baseline commit: 2538574
- Go version: 1.24.5
- Go unit tests: PASS (user-run baseline)
- Go race checks: PASS (user-run baseline)
- go vet: No diagnostics reported in user output
- Results apply to the confirmed baseline, not future changes.

## Implemented in the Confirmed Repository

- Enrollment eligibility validation
- In-memory entitlement provider
- Workflow execution state and transition history
- Single-winner workflow claims
- Owner-aware workflow completion and failure
- Version-checked repository updates
- Failure reasons preserved by Fail()
- In-memory repository with independent snapshots

## Harness Status

- AGENTS.md: implemented and committed
- AGENTS.md context-routing rules: implemented
- PROGRESS.md: implemented and committed
- init.sh: implemented; local execution verified
- feature_list.json: implemented; initial JSON validation passed
- scripts/validate_features.py: implemented; G1-G7 tracker validation PASS
  with `python3 scripts/validate_features.py feature_list.json`
- scripts/test_validate_features.py: 27 unittest tests PASS with
  `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p "test_*.py" -v`
  (bytecode writes disabled); original feature_list.json remains unchanged
- scripts/verify.sh: implemented; resolves the root from its own location,
  checks tools, and runs tracker validation, Python harness tests, Go unit
  tests, race detection, go vet, and both Git whitespace checks in order.
  Stops on the first failure, identifies the check, and preserves its exit code.
- scripts/test_verify.sh: 12 isolated shell tests PASS; root/nested invocation
  (including spaces), ordered commands/headings, final PASS, seven command
  failures preserving exit codes 41-47 with no later commands or PASS,
  and missing python3/go/git exiting 127 before any checks.
- Lesson 9 verification (2026-11-08): clean starting tree on main at
  0a6fbc7794fee2cd4d2137631e8805796a3a9336; local HEAD matched cached
  origin/main. Remote was not fetched. No Go source changes since the
  documented 2538574 baseline; no local M3 engine implementation found.
- Commands: `bash init.sh`, `python3 scripts/validate_features.py feature_list.json`,
  `bash -n scripts/verify.sh`, `bash -n scripts/test_verify.sh`, and
  `bash scripts/test_verify.sh` all exited 0.
- Actual `bash scripts/verify.sh`: first exited 1 at Go unit tests because
  the sandbox denied Go build-cache access; no final PASS was printed.
  Retried with permission for cache access and exited 0: tracker PASS,
  27 Python tests PASS, Go unit tests PASS, Go race tests PASS, go vet
  without diagnostics, and both Git whitespace checks PASS.
- Lesson 9 changes are limited to scripts/verify.sh, scripts/test_verify.sh,
  AGENTS.md, and this Harness Status section; feature_list.json and Go
  files remain unchanged. Await human review; no commit or push performed.
- AGENTS.md now requires unified verification before engineering acceptance
  and retains individual commands for targeted debugging.
- After documentation updates, `git diff --check` and
  `git diff --cached --check` exited 0. `git status --short` exited 0:
  AGENTS.md and PROGRESS.md modified; both new shell scripts untracked.
- Codex local execution: verified at commit a20b8d1
- Fresh-agent context reconstruction: passed
- docs/ROADMAP.md: implemented and committed
- docs/INTERVIEW_DEFENSE.md: implemented and committed
- Interview-defense protocol: defined; practice during M3 pending
- Current M3 active task: none
- Next planned task: M3.1, pending authorization

## Current Engineering Milestone

M3 - Reusable Workflow Definition and Execution Engine

Planned capabilities:

- Reusable workflow definitions
- Triggers
- Conditions
- Branching
- Action handlers
- Wait/delay steps

Status:

- M3 requirements identified
- Latest local implementation not yet reconciled with GitHub
- Do not assume planned M3 capabilities are complete

## Current Blocker

Confirm whether newer M3 code exists locally and has been
committed and pushed to GitHub.

## Next Actions

1. Reconcile current local code with GitHub main.
2. Update this file to match the actual implementation.
3. Select one bounded M3 task with acceptance criteria.
4. Implement the initialization and verification harness.
5. Run checks and record evidence before marking work complete.

## Session Handoff Rules

At the end of each coding session, record:

- Commit or working-tree reference
- Behavior implemented
- Files changed
- Tests actually run and their outcomes
- Unresolved errors or blockers
- Next action

Do not replace a failed check with an unsupported PASS claim.
Do not mark a feature complete without its acceptance evidence.

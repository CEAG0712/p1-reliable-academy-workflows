# P1 — Durable Session Handoff

## 1. Project and business purpose

Build a reusable Go workflow execution engine. Student enrollment and
course access are the first use case; keep business logic outside the
generic engine. This is an in-memory engineering portfolio prototype.

## 2. Repository identity and checkpoint revision

- Repository: CEAG0712/p1-reliable-academy-workflows; branch: main.
- Module: example.com/p1-reliable-academy-workflows; Go: 1.24.5.
- Previous verified checkpoint and Lesson 10 starting HEAD:
  `b0e4db4ec4d20a7e3d150de0342e9f80821669cb`, the confirmed Lesson 9
  GitHub commit (harness - Unified Verification).
- On 2026-11-08, starting tree was clean and HEAD matched cached
  origin/main. No fetch performed; live local-to-remote synchronization
  is unverified.
- Current state: Lesson 10 changes to AGENTS.md, PROGRESS.md, and this
  new document are uncommitted, pending human review and commit/push.
  HEAD remains the previous checkpoint; no future SHA is asserted.
  Recheck actual HEAD and working tree at the next startup.

## 3. Confirmed implemented milestones

Source/tests inspected at the starting revision support:

- M1: create-only repository storage, independent snapshots, versioning,
  stale-version rejection, and single-winner claims within one repository
  instance and process.
- M2: owner-aware completion/failure, attempts, and transition history.
- Exercise 82: SaveIfVersion accepts completion only; failures must use
  Fail with a nonempty reason. LastError and failure-history reasons persist.
- Enrollment eligibility, tenant/student/course entitlement identity, and
  locally idempotent grants are implemented separately.
- Initialization, tracker validation, Python harness tests, and unified
  verification scripts exist. M3 is not implemented.

Evidence: workflow.go, workflow_repository.go, their tests, enrollment.go,
and enrollment_test.go. Preserve ownership, versions, diagnostics, and history.

## 4. Current tracker state

feature_list.json is unchanged: all ten tasks M3.1 through M3.10 are
pending; active_task_id is null; work_in_progress_limit is 1. Preserve
their existing order, dependencies, scope, and acceptance criteria in
that file and docs/ROADMAP.md section 13. No task was activated or verified.

## 5. Verification evidence and commands

- Historical user-run unit/race/vet evidence applies to baseline 2538574;
  its test date was not recorded. It is not evidence of testing later HEADs.
- Historical Lesson 9 evidence (2026-11-08), recorded in PROGRESS.md,
  began at 0a6fbc7794fee2cd4d2137631e8805796a3a9336 with harness edits:
  verifier exit 1 from denied Go cache access, then permission-enabled
  rerun exit 0; syntax checks and 12 isolated shell tests also passed.
  That work was subsequently recorded in b0e4db4; these original checks
  were not run as a clean checkout of that later commit.
- Newly executed Lesson 10 checks (2026-11-08), starting at b0e4db4:
  `bash init.sh` and
  `python3 scripts/validate_features.py feature_list.json` exited 0.
  `bash scripts/verify.sh` initially exited 1 at Go unit tests due to
  sandbox cache denial, after tracker and 27 Python tests passed.
  The permission-enabled rerun exited 0: tracker, 27 Python tests,
  `go test -count=1 ./...`, `go test -race -count=1 ./...`, `go vet ./...`,
  `git diff --check`, and `git diff --cached --check` all passed.

These local checks establish no cloud integration or production outcome.

## 6. Unresolved blockers and limitations

Live GitHub reconciliation and explicit M3 authorization remain required.
A fresh-agent reconstruction test of this new handoff is pending.
docs/ROADMAP.md contains historical repository/harness snapshots; use its
scope, but reconcile status against current files, Git, and tests.
Process-local locks and memory do not establish distributed exactly-once
behavior, durable recovery, complete orchestration, or production readiness.
No deployment or measured business/performance results are established.

## 7. Next bounded engineering task

First review/test the handoff and reconcile the repository. M3.1 — Workflow
Definition Models is next, but is NOT authorized for implementation yet.
Acceptance: models compile and tests demonstrate two distinct workflow
definitions without business-specific engine fields. Preserve the approved
ten-task sequence in feature_list.json and docs/ROADMAP.md section 13.

## 8. Authorization boundaries

Lesson 10 authorizes only these three documentation changes. No M3,
tracker, Go source/tests, initialization/verifier changes, or dependencies.
Do not discard local changes, commit, push, deploy, use sudo, access
production, or add/expose credentials. A task listed as next grants no
implementation authorization. Await human review before commit/push.

## 9. Fresh-agent startup procedure

1. Read AGENTS.md, PROGRESS.md, and this document; run `bash init.sh`
   and review warnings. Initialization grants no implementation authority.
2. Read README.md, go.mod, feature_list.json, scripts/verify.sh, and
   relevant roadmap sections. Inspect actual source and tests.
3. Record `git status --short`, `git branch --show-current`,
   `git rev-parse HEAD`, and `git log -5 --oneline`; cross-check the
   previous checkpoint and current tree. Fetch/compare origin/main only
   when remote access is authorized; cached refs are not live evidence.
4. Run `python3 scripts/validate_features.py feature_list.json`; identify
   the authorized bounded task and acceptance criteria before activation.
   Preserve WIP = 1. Stop for missing requirements or authorization.
5. Run `bash scripts/verify.sh` before requesting engineering acceptance;
   report actual commands, exits, failures, reruns, and revision/tree tested.

## 10. Session handoff update rules

After an authorized engineering session, update this document when state
or evidence changes. Record previous checkpoint, current observed HEAD,
uncommitted files, behavior, dated checks/results, blockers, and next action.
Keep historical evidence tied to its revision and context. Never mark a
task verified without reviewed acceptance evidence and actual tests.
Never invent a future SHA, claim a clean tree after edits without observing
it, or call pending work committed. A handoff update creates a new working
state before its commit exists; verify its actual revision at next startup.

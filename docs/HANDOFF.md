# P1 — Durable Session Handoff

## 1. Project and business purpose

Build a reusable Go workflow execution engine. Student enrollment and
course access are the first use case; keep business logic outside the
generic engine. This is an in-memory engineering portfolio prototype.

## 2. Repository identity and checkpoint revision

- Repository: CEAG0712/p1-reliable-academy-workflows; branch: main.
- Module: example.com/p1-reliable-academy-workflows; Go: 1.24.5.
- Previous verified checkpoint and Lesson 10 starting HEAD:
  `b0e4db4ec4d20a7e3d150de0342e9f80821669cb`, the confirmed Lesson 9
  GitHub commit (harness - Unified Verification).
- On 2026-11-08, starting tree was clean and HEAD matched cached
  origin/main. No fetch performed; live local-to-remote synchronization
  is unverified.
- Lesson 10 was committed as `01ef1e37f288459276d3025335b7cdcde669f733`
  (chore: add durable coding-agent handoff), confirmed in local Git history.
- Lesson 11 started at 01ef1e37f288459276d3025335b7cdcde669f733; its five
  harness/documentation files were subsequently committed in a5b345d.
- Current observed HEAD (2026-11-08): a5b345d99075debfe652d0182f0374466b7ff8bc,
  main. M3.1 started clean; current changes are uncommitted and are listed below.
- Read-only preparation queried live GitHub main using the GitHub connector and
  observed the same a5b345d revision. No fetch or push was performed. That observation
  supersedes prior live-sync uncertainty; remote state can change afterward.

## 3. Confirmed implemented milestones

Source/tests inspected at the starting revision support:

- M1: create-only repository storage, independent snapshots, versioning,
  stale-version rejection, and single-winner claims within one repository
  instance and process.
- M2: owner-aware completion/failure, attempts, and transition history.
- Exercise 82: SaveIfVersion accepts completion only; failures must use
  Fail with a nonempty reason. LastError and failure-history reasons persist.
- Enrollment eligibility, tenant/student/course entitlement identity, and
  locally idempotent grants are implemented separately.
- Initialization, tracker validation, Python harness tests, and unified
  verification scripts exist. M3.1 models are implemented locally; the runner is not.

Evidence: workflow.go, workflow_repository.go, their tests, enrollment.go,
and enrollment_test.go. Preserve ownership, versions, diagnostics, and history.

## 4. Current tracker state

M3.1 was explicitly authorized, activated, implemented and reviewed against its
acceptance criteria by Codex. It is marked verified with evidence tied to HEAD plus
uncommitted changes. This is agent review, not human acceptance. M3.2 through M3.10
remain pending; active_task_id is null and work_in_progress_limit remains 1. No
later task was activated or implemented. Preserve the approved sequence and scope.

## 5. Verification evidence and commands

- Historical user-run unit/race/vet evidence applies to baseline 2538574;
  its test date was not recorded. It is not evidence of testing later HEADs.
- Historical Lesson 9 evidence (2026-11-08), recorded in PROGRESS.md,
  began at 0a6fbc7794fee2cd4d2137631e8805796a3a9336 with harness edits:
  verifier exit 1 from denied Go cache access, then permission-enabled
  rerun exit 0; syntax checks and 12 isolated shell tests also passed.
  That work was subsequently recorded in b0e4db4; these original checks
  were not run as a clean checkout of that later commit.
- Newly executed Lesson 10 checks (2026-11-08), starting at b0e4db4:
  `bash init.sh` and
  `python3 scripts/validate_features.py feature_list.json` exited 0.
  `bash scripts/verify.sh` initially exited 1 at Go unit tests due to
  sandbox cache denial, after tracker and 27 Python tests passed.
  The permission-enabled rerun exited 0: tracker, 27 Python tests,
  `go test -count=1 ./...`, `go test -race -count=1 ./...`, `go vet ./...`,
  `git diff --check`, and `git diff --cached --check` all passed.
- Lesson 11 checks (2026-11-08), starting at 01ef1e3 with the five
  uncommitted harness/documentation files listed above: initialization and
  tracker validation exited 0; Python unittest discovery with bytecode disabled
  exited 0 (44 tests: 27 existing, 17 preflight). M3.1 preflight exited 0 with
  HUMAN APPROVAL REQUIRED and no activation; M3.2 exited 1 for unverified
  M3.1, the expected successful negative test. Exact commands are in PROGRESS.md.
  Unified verifier initially exited 1 at go vet due to sandbox cache denial,
  after Python, Go unit and race checks passed; permission-enabled rerun
  exited 0, including tracker, Python, unit/race/vet and both whitespace checks.
  Separate Git whitespace checks and status exited 0. Read-only assertions
  confirmed tracker equality to HEAD and starting SHA-256, ten pending tasks,
  null active_task_id, WIP 1, and exactly five authorized changed files.
  No Go, tracker, initialization or existing verification scripts changed.
  No M3 work, commit, push, or deployment was performed.

- M3.1 (2026-11-08), HEAD a5b345d plus uncommitted changes: initialization,
  tracker validation and M3.1 preflight exited 0 before activation. Human approval
  came from the explicit user message, not preflight success. Focused command
  `go test -count=1 -run '^TestWorkflowDefinition' ./...` exited 1 (undefined model
  types), then exited 0 after adding the models. Initial `bash scripts/verify.sh`
  exited 1 with four validator fixture failures. After fixture correction it exited
  1 at Go unit tests from sandbox Go-cache denial; permission-enabled rerun exited 0:
  tracker, all 44 Python tests, Go unit/race tests, go vet and both whitespace checks.
  Commands and acceptance review are recorded in PROGRESS.md and feature_list.json.

Final verification after tracker/checkpoint updates: sandbox run exited 1 at
go vet after tracker, all 44 Python tests, Go unit and race tests passed.
Permission-enabled final rerun of `bash scripts/verify.sh` exited 0 with
all six checks PASS. Final scope assertions confirmed M3.2-M3.10 unchanged,
WIP 1, active_task_id null and existing lifecycle/business Go files unchanged.
Only this evidence text was added afterward; tracker validation and both
Git whitespace checks were rerun successfully.

These local checks establish no cloud integration or production outcome.

## 6. Unresolved blockers and limitations

M3.1 authorization and checkpoint reconciliation are established above. Later tasks
require separate authorization. There is no current M3.1 technical blocker.
The user reports the Lesson 10 fresh-agent acceptance test succeeded.
This is historical user-reported evidence, not a newly executed test here.
docs/ROADMAP.md contains historical repository/harness snapshots; use its
scope, but reconcile status against current files, Git, and tests.
Process-local locks and memory do not establish distributed exactly-once
behavior, durable recovery, complete orchestration, or production readiness.
No deployment or measured business/performance results are established.
Preflight checks a tracker snapshot only: it does not authenticate approval,
reserve eligibility, or enforce authorization. Later state changes require
another check; an eligible result never grants implementation authority.

## 7. Current result and next bounded task

Created workflow_definition.go and workflow_definition_test.go: generic definition,
trigger and step models describe enrollment branching and customer follow-up with
an action/wait/action graph. Step IDs are map keys; empty successor means path end.
Named action/condition references and delays are configuration only. No business
payload fields, graph validation, trigger matching, handlers, runner or resume logic.
M1/M2/Exercise 82 source and tests are unchanged and pass regression checks.

Uncommitted files: workflow_definition.go, workflow_definition_test.go,
scripts/test_task_preflight.py, scripts/test_validate_features.py, feature_list.json,
PROGRESS.md and docs/HANDOFF.md. The two Python test files now establish independent
fixture states instead of assuming the live tracker stays pending. Production
preflight/validator scripts are unchanged. No new dependencies were added.

Next: human review of this uncommitted M3.1 result. M3.2 is pending and unauthorized;
recheck state, tracker validation and its preflight before any future activation.
Historical roadmap harness/revision statements remain stale; Section 13 scope is
unchanged. README's whole-milestone acceptance status remains consistent.

## 8. Authorization boundaries

The user authorized M3.1 activation and implementation under the bounded proposal,
including tracker and checkpoint documentation evidence. Do not commit, push,
deploy, start M3.2, alter production resources, or add/expose credentials. This
session performed none of those actions. No human acceptance is asserted.

## 9. Fresh-agent startup procedure

1. Read AGENTS.md, PROGRESS.md, and this document; run `bash init.sh`
   and review warnings. Initialization grants no implementation authority.
2. Read README.md, go.mod, feature_list.json, scripts/verify.sh, and
   relevant roadmap sections. Inspect actual source and tests.
3. Record `git status --short`, `git branch --show-current`,
   `git rev-parse HEAD`, and `git log -5 --oneline`; cross-check the
   previous checkpoint and current tree. Fetch/compare origin/main only
   when remote access is authorized; cached refs are not live evidence.
4. Run `python3 scripts/validate_features.py feature_list.json`; identify
   the authorized bounded task and acceptance criteria before activation.
   Before requesting M3 activation, run
   `python3 scripts/task_preflight.py --task TASK_ID`. Eligibility is not
   authorization: obtain explicit human approval before activation or
   implementation. Success must not automatically trigger activation,
   implementation, commits, or pushes. Preserve WIP = 1. Stop for missing
   requirements or authorization. Preflight is not an enforcement system.
5. Run `bash scripts/verify.sh` before requesting engineering acceptance;
   report actual commands, exits, failures, reruns, and revision/tree tested.

## 10. Session handoff update rules

After an authorized engineering session, update this document when state
or evidence changes. Record previous checkpoint, current observed HEAD,
uncommitted files, behavior, dated checks/results, blockers, and next action.
Keep historical evidence tied to its revision and context. Never mark a
task verified without reviewed acceptance evidence and actual tests.
Never invent a future SHA, claim a clean tree after edits without observing
it, or call pending work committed. A handoff update creates a new working
state before its commit exists; verify its actual revision at next startup.
